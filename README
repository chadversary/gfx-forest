My multi-repo graphics projects as a collection of git submodules and build scripts.

Individual projects are maintained as separate branches.

This branch is for development of Vulkan extension
VK_EXT_external_memory_acquire_unmodified.

To fetch the source for everything, run:
    git submodule update --init

The dEQP branch adds testcases
`dEQP-VK.dEQP-VK.memory.external_memory_acquire_unmodified.*`.  Currently,
there exist tests for VK_EXT_external_memory_dma_buf which use Vulkan as the
memory allocator (as opposed as using GBM as allocator). There do not exist
tests yet for VK_ANDROID_external_memory_android_hardware_buffer.

I tested the new dEQP testcases with Anvil (the Intel Mesa driver).
You can too by running:
    cd bin
    ./hh-pkg mesa install
    ./hh-pkg deqp install
    ./hh-intel-env ./hh-deqp-vk -n 'dEQP-VK.memory.external_memory_acquire_unmodified.*'

To change how a package is built, or add a new package, see the package files
in `config/pkg` and the script `bin/hh-pkg`.
